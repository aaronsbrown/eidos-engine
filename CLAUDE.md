## Non-negotiable golden rules

| #: | AI *may* do                                                            | AI *must NOT* do                                                                    |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| G-0 | Whenever unsure about something that's related to the project, ask the developer for clarification before making changes.    |  ❌ Write changes or use tools when you are not sure about something project specific, or if you don't have context for a particular feature/decision. |
| G-1 | Add/update **`AIDEV-NOTE:` anchor comments** near non-trivial edited code. | ❌ Delete or mangle existing `AIDEV-` comments.                                     |
| G-2 | For changes >300 LOC or >3 files, **ask for confirmation**.            | ❌ Refactor large modules without human guidance.                                     |
| G-3 | Stay within the current task context. Inform the dev if it'd be better to start afresh.     | ❌ Continue work from a prior prompt after "new task" – start a fresh session.      |
| G-4 | **NEVER** merge feature branches to main without explicit approval.    | ❌ Merge feature branches, even if "working state" - always ask for approval first. |
| G-5 | **Main UI features MUST be implemented via TDD**. Write tests first, then implement. | ❌ Implement main UI features without tests. Note: Visualizations don't need pixel-level verification, focus on React app behavior. |

## Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for.

### Guidelines

- Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- Keep them concise (≤ 120 chars).
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **locate existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  - too long, or
  - too complex, or
  - very important, or
  - confusing, or
  - could have a bug unrelated to the task you are currently working on.

Example:

```typescript
# AIDEV-NOTE: perf-hot-path; avoid extra allocations (see ADR-24)
export default function BarcodeGenerator...
    ...
```

## Git Workflow & Commit Discipline

### Branching Strategy

- **Always use feature branches** for development work (never commit directly to main)
- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/enhance-rar-testbench`, `fix/uart-timeout-bug`
- **Create branches early**: Before making any code changes
- **Single developer workflow**: Create feature branch → develop → test → **get approval** → merge to main
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: **NEVER merge feature branches to main without explicit developer approval**
- **Merging protocol**: Always ask "Should I merge this feature branch to main?" before executing merge commands

### Commit Standards

- **Granular commits**: One logical change per commit.
- **Tag AI-generated commits**: e.g., `feat: optimise feed query [AI]`.
- **Clear commit messages**: Explain the *why*; link to issues/ADRs if architectural.
- **Review AI-generated code**: Never merge code you don't understand.

---

## Architecture

### Core System

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with technical blueprint aesthetic
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library

### Pattern Generator System

- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular, extensible pattern generator system
- **Common Interface**: All generators implement `PatternGeneratorProps`
- **Control System**: Real-time parameter adjustment via uniform/state controls
- **Rendering**: Mix of Canvas 2D and WebGL for optimal performance

---

   - Audio visualizer simulation
   - No controls implemented yet

3. **Noise Field** (`noise-field-generator.tsx`)
   - WebGL GLSL shader
   - 3D Simplex noise with time animation
   - No controls implemented yet

4. **Pixelated Noise** (`pixelated-noise-generator.tsx`)
   - Canvas 2D with retro pixel blocks

   - **✅ Full control panel implemented**
   - Controls: particle count, speed, brightness, trail length, jitter amount

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Pattern Generator Interface

```typescript
interface PatternGeneratorProps {
  width: number
  height: number
  className?: string
  controls?: PatternControl[]
  onControlChange?: (controlId: string, value: number | string | boolean) => void
}

interface PatternControl {
  id: string
  label: string
  type: 'range' | 'color' | 'checkbox' | 'select'
  min?: number
  max?: number
  step?: number
  defaultValue: number | string | boolean
  options?: { value: string | number; label: string }[]
}
```

### Adding New Pattern Generators

1. Create component in `components/pattern-generators/`
2. Implement `PatternGeneratorProps` interface
3. Add to exports in `components/pattern-generators/index.ts`
4. Follow existing patterns for control panel implementation
5. For WebGL generators, use external shader loading system

### Shader Loading System (Issue #14)

**External Shader Architecture:**
- **Shader files** stored in `shaders/vertex/` and `shaders/fragment/`
- **Dynamic loading** via `loadShader()` utility function
- **Type-safe uniforms** with TypeScript definitions
- **TouchDesigner import** workflow for external shader integration

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
import { loadShader, createShaderProgram } from "@/lib/shader-loader"

// Load external shaders
const shaderProgram = await loadShader('shader-name')
const program = createShaderProgram(gl, shaderProgram.vertex, shaderProgram.fragment)
```

**Benefits:**
- GLSL syntax highlighting in external `.frag` and `.vert` files
- Improved maintainability and code organization
- Easy TouchDesigner shader imports
- Hot reload support during development
- Shader reusability across multiple generators

### Control Panel Architecture

- **Real-time updates**: Changes immediately affect the pattern
- **Technical aesthetic**: Monospace labels, yellow accents, technical styling
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Consistent layout**: 2-column grid with proper spacing

---

## Design System

### Visual Theme

- **Color Palette**: Grayscale with yellow (#FACC15) accents
- **Typography**: Monospace fonts, uppercase labels, technical styling
- **Layout**: Clean, minimal, blueprint-inspired design
- **Grid System**: Subtle grid overlays, technical annotations

### UI Components

- **Range Sliders**: Yellow accent color, real-time value display
- **Select Dropdowns**: Technical naming (e.g., "RETRO_PALETTE")
- **Technical Overlays**: Pattern type labels, rendering method indicators
- **Corner Markers**: Yellow L-shaped borders for pattern containers

---

## Performance Guidelines

### WebGL Patterns

- **External shaders**: Use `loadShader()` for shader management
- **Constant loop bounds**: GLSL shaders must use compile-time constants
- **Uniform optimization**: Minimize uniform updates per frame
- **Proper cleanup**: `cancelAnimationFrame` and shader program deletion
- **Efficient buffers**: Vertex buffer management and reuse
- **Type safety**: Use shader type definitions from `lib/shader-types.ts`

### Canvas 2D Patterns

- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps animations
- Minimize canvas context operations
- Cache calculated values where possible
- Proper memory management

## AI Assistant Workflow: Step-by-Step Methodology

When responding to user instructions, the AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.) should follow this process to ensure clarity, correctness, and maintainability:

1. **Consult Relevant Guidance**: When the user gives an instruction, consult the relevant files in the project directory to gather insight
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Based on what you could gather, see if there's any need for clarifications. If so, ask the user targeted questions before proceeding.
3. **Break Down & Plan**: Break down the task at hand and chalk out a rough plan for carrying it out, referencing project conventions and best practices.
4. **Create Feature Branch**: For any code changes, create a feature branch before starting work (never work directly on main)
5. **Trivial Tasks**: If the plan/request is trivial, go ahead and get started immediately.
6. **Non-Trivial Tasks**: Otherwise, present the plan to the user for review and iterate based on their feedback.
7. **Track Progress**: Use a to-do list (internally, or optionally in a `TODOS.md` file) to keep track of your progress on multi-step or complex tasks.
8. **If Stuck, Re-plan**: If you get stuck or blocked, return to step 3 to re-evaluate and adjust your plan.
9. **Update Documentation**: Once the user's request is fulfilled, update relevant anchor comments (`AIDEV-NOTE`, etc.) and `AGENTS.md` files in the files and directories you touched.
10. **User Review**: After completing the task, ask the user to review what you've done, and repeat the process as needed.
11. **Session Boundaries**: If the user's request isn't directly related to the current context and can be safely started in a fresh session, suggest starting from scratch to avoid context confusion.
