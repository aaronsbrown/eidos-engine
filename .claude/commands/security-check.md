Please conduct a comprehensive security audit of the code you just implemented. Verify the
  following security requirements:

  Frontend Security:

- No API keys, tokens, or credentials exposed in client-side code
- No sensitive configuration data in environment variables accessible to the browser
- No hardcoded secrets, passwords, or internal URLs
- Proper input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Protection against XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content rendering

  Data Security:

- No sensitive data logged to console or error messages
- Proper handling of user data without exposure in URLs or local storage
- No sensitive information in component props that could be inspected

  Vulnerability Assessment:

- Check for potential injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, Command injection)
- Verify proper authentication and authorization controls
- Review file upload functionality for security risks
- Assess any external API integrations for security compliance
- Check for insecure direct object references

  Best Practices Compliance:

- Ensure HTTPS-only configurations where applicable
- Verify proper error handling that doesn't leak system information
- Confirm secure headers and CORS policies are properly configured
- Review any third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities

  Please document any security concerns found and provide specific remediation steps for each issue.
