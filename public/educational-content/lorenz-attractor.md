## Layer 1: "What is this?" (Intuitive/Experiential)

The Lorenz Attractor is a beautiful, mesmerizing pattern that looks like a butterfly or a figure-eight twisting in space. It's a perfect example of how very simple mathematical rules can create something that looks incredibly complex and organic. The lines you see are the paths of particles that are constantly moving but never repeat their exact journey, yet they always stay within the bounds of this butterfly shape. It's a visual representation of organized chaos.

## Layer 2: "How does this work?" (Conceptual/Mechanical)

The Lorenz Attractor is generated by a system of three simple differential equations. Imagine a particle floating in 3D space. At every moment, its next position is determined by its current position (x, y, z) and three constants: sigma, rho, and beta. These equations describe a continuous feedback loop where the particle's path is constantly influencing itself. Even though the rules are simple and deterministic (no randomness is involved), the resulting system is chaotic. This means that two particles starting incredibly close together will have wildly different paths over time, a phenomenon known as the "butterfly effect."

## Layer 3: "Show me the code" (Technical/Formal)

The core of the Lorenz Attractor is a function that calculates the change in a particle's position over a small time step (dt). This is typically done using Euler's method to approximate the solution to the differential equations.

```typescript
// In src/lib/math/lorenz.ts
export function calculateLorenzPoint(
  x: number, y: number, z: number,
  sigma: number, rho: number, beta: number, dt: number
): { newX: number; newY: number; newZ: number } {
  const dx = sigma * (y - x);
  const dy = x * (rho - z) - y;
  const dz = x * y - beta * z;

  const newX = x + dx * dt;
  const newY = y + dy * dt;
  const newZ = z + dz * dt;

  return { newX, newY, newZ };
}
```

In the visualization, we maintain an array of particles and, in each animation frame, we update their positions using this function. The particles move through 3D space, creating the characteristic butterfly-shaped attractor pattern.
