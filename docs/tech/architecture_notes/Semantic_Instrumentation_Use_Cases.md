# Use cases for Semantic Instrumentation

## **Enhanced Pattern Generator Definitions**

Benefits for an Agent (and You):
Smarter Filtering/Searching: An agent could understand queries like:
"Show me all 'StrangeAttractor' patterns that use 'ChaosTheory' and are '3D_Simulated'."
"Which patterns have 'High' computational complexity and use 'WEBGL_2.0'?"
"Find patterns related to 'lorenz-attractor'."
Automated Documentation Generation: The agent could use this structured data to help generate overviews, comparison tables, or update READMEs.
Guided Refactoring: "Refactor all 'CANVAS_2D' patterns with 'High' complexity to use WebGL if possible."
Content Linking: Automatically link patterns to their educational docs.
Better Code Generation for New Patterns: When you ask to create a new pattern, say a "Fractal," the agent could look at existing "Fractal" definitions for common keyMathematicalConcepts or visualCharacteristics to guide its generation.
Test Generation Hints: performance.typicalFrameRateTarget could inform performance test expectations. interactionStyle could guide what kind of user interactions to test.

## Semantic Annotations for Controls

Benefits:
Smarter UI Generation for Controls: An agent could group controls by role or highlight PrimaryParameters.
Automated Tooltips/Help Text: Use description for UI tooltips.
Guided Exploration for Users (and AI): typicalRangeForInterestingResults could inform UI hints or AI exploration strategies.
Performance Aware Interactions: The AI could be more cautious when suggesting changes to controls where impactsPerformance is true.

## "Intent Tags" as Code Comments (More Formalized)

Benefits:
Targeted Code Analysis by Agent: "Find all refactor_candidate sections with high-cyclomatic-complexity."
Automated Sanity Checks: "Verify all accessibility intents are met."
Knowledge Graph Building: These comments could be extracted to build a graph of code properties and relationships.
