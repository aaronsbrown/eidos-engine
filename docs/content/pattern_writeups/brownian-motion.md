## Layer 1: "What is this?" (Intuitive/Experiential)

**What you're seeing:** A mesmerizing dance of particles that never quite know where they're going next.

Imagine you're watching tiny pollen grains floating on water under a microscope, getting bumped around by invisible water molecules. Each bright yellow particle is constantly jiggling and wandering in seemingly random directions, leaving ghostly trails that show where they've been.

**The beauty:** The particles appear to have their own personalities - some move faster, some slower, some seem to explore more boldly while others stay closer to home. Yet they're all following the same simple rule: take a step in a random direction, then repeat forever.

**Interactive experience:** 
- Watch how increasing particle count creates a busier, more complex pattern
- Notice how speed changes affect the energy of the entire system
- See how trail length reveals the "memory" of each particle's journey
- Observe how jitter amount controls the randomness - more jitter means more chaotic, unpredictable movement

This is one of nature's most fundamental patterns - the same mathematics that describes pollen in water also explains stock market fluctuations, the spread of diseases, and even how galaxies form.

## Layer 2: "How does this work?" (Conceptual/Mechanical)

**The Mathematics:**

Brownian motion is a **random walk** - at each time step, a particle moves in a random direction by a random amount. The key insight is that this seemingly chaotic behavior creates predictable statistical patterns over time.

**The Algorithm:**

1. **Initial Setup:** Each particle starts at a random position on the screen
2. **Movement Components:** Each particle's position is updated using:
   - **Deterministic drift:** Smooth, predictable movement (sine/cosine waves)
   - **Random jitter:** Unpredictable noise that mimics molecular collisions
   - **Time evolution:** Both components change continuously over time

3. **Trail Visualization:** The system remembers each particle's past positions, drawing them as fading points to show the path history

4. **Mathematical Foundation:**
   ```
   Position(t) = StartPosition + DriftComponent(t) + RandomComponent(t)
   
   Where:
   - DriftComponent = smooth oscillations that prevent particles from clustering
   - RandomComponent = noise that creates the characteristic "jittery" motion
   ```

**Why it works:** Real Brownian motion occurs when tiny particles are bombarded by even tinier molecules. We simulate this by adding controlled randomness to each particle's movement. The trails show the particle's **diffusion** - how it spreads out from its starting point over time.

**Key Properties:**
- **Scale invariance:** Zoom in on any part of the motion and it looks statistically similar
- **Unpredictability:** You can't predict exactly where a particle will be, but you can predict the probability distribution
- **Memory-less:** Each step is independent of all previous steps (the particle has no "memory")

## Layer 3: "Show me the code" (Technical/Formal)

**Core Implementation Details:**

The Brownian motion is implemented using WebGL shaders for high-performance parallel computation of multiple particles:

**Particle Position Calculation** (brownian-motion-generator.tsx:78-102):
```glsl
vec2 getParticlePos(float id) {
  vec2 seed = vec2(id * 12.9898, id * 78.233);
  
  // Random starting position
  vec2 startPos = vec2(
    0.2 + 0.6 * hash(seed),
    0.2 + 0.6 * hash(seed + vec2(1.0))
  );
  
  // Deterministic random walk (sine/cosine oscillations)
  float walkScale = 0.15;
  vec2 offset = vec2(
    sin(u_time * 0.8 * u_speed + id * 2.1) * hash(seed + vec2(2.0)) * walkScale,
    cos(u_time * 1.1 * u_speed + id * 1.7) * hash(seed + vec2(3.0)) * walkScale
  );
  
  // Add Brownian noise (the key randomness)
  offset += vec2(
    hash(seed + vec2(u_time * 0.5 * u_speed)) - 0.5,
    hash(seed + vec2(u_time * 0.7 * u_speed)) - 0.5
  ) * u_jitterAmount;
  
  return fract(startPos + offset);
}
```

**Hash Function for Pseudo-Randomness** (brownian-motion-generator.tsx:72-76):
```glsl
float hash(vec2 p) {
  vec3 p3 = fract(vec3(p.xyx) * 0.1031);
  p3 += dot(p3, p3.yzx + 33.33);
  return fract((p3.x + p3.y) * p3.z);
}
```

**Trail Rendering System** (brownian-motion-generator.tsx:143-181):
The system calculates historical positions by re-running the position function with past time values, creating smooth trails that fade over time.

**Key Technical Features:**

- **WebGL Acceleration:** All particle calculations run in parallel on the GPU
- **Deterministic Randomness:** Uses hash functions with time-based seeds for reproducible "randomness"
- **Aspect Ratio Correction:** Ensures particles remain circular regardless of canvas dimensions
- **Real-time Parameter Control:** All movement characteristics can be adjusted live via uniforms
- **Trail Memory System:** Efficiently renders particle history without storing position arrays

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Fragment Shader Rendering:** Each pixel determines its color based on proximity to particles
- **Loop Unrolling:** Limited particle count (20 max) for consistent frame rates
- **Efficient Distance Calculations:** Uses squared distances where possible
- **Batched Uniform Updates:** All control parameters updated once per frame

**Mathematical Implementation:**
The random walk combines:
1. **Periodic functions** (sin/cos) for smooth drift
2. **Hash-based noise** for stochastic jitter
3. **Time-dependent seeds** for continuous evolution
4. **Modular arithmetic** (fract) for screen wrapping

The result is a mathematically accurate simulation of 2D Brownian motion with visually appealing trails and real-time parameter control.

**Architecture Integration:**
- Implements `PatternGeneratorProps` for consistent control interface
- Uses WebGL context management with proper cleanup
- Integrates with React lifecycle for animation management
- Follows project's technical aesthetic with yellow particle coloring
